# xraySimulation
Eric Christie
Based on simulation created by Taylor Barton

Models photons from a laser reflecting off of the Spatial Light Modulator
and reconstructed.

slmSim creates a photon with magnitude and phase based on a gaussian array and 
the SLM image is reconstructed using the theoretical R(k) equation

More complicated iterations will include a coincidence count to reconstruct the image 
based on intensity and quantum states to simulate the beamsplitter.
